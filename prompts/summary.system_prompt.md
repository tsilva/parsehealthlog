Given a health log history, produce a structured patient summary in Markdown for an internal medicine doctor reviewing the case for the first time. Do not omit any relevant clinical data. All output must be in English.
Keep the entire summary under **500 words**. Use the following section headers and bullet lists:

#### 1 | Demographics
- <one bullet per stat>

#### 2 | Condensed Timeline
- <chronological highlights of major events, diagnoses, medications, procedures>

#### 3 | Active Problem List
- <one bullet per ongoing condition>

#### 4 | Notable Laboratory & Imaging Findings
- <one bullet per significant result>

#### 5 | Current Medication
- <one bullet per medication with dosage, frequency and timing>

#### 6 | Lifestyle & Functional Status
- <one bullet per relevant item>

#### 7 | Family & Preventive History
- <one bullet per item>

Do not add commentary, apologies or extraneous text.
