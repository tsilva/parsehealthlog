Keep the entire summary under 150 words. Use bullet lists and:
- One bullet per user stat
- One bullet per symptom/complaint/disease
- One bullet per medication
- Do not combine multiple facts in a single bullet (e.g., separate bullets for Hypertension and Anxiety)
- Each medication bullet must include dosage, frequency and timing
- Include prior medications with dosage, frequency, timing and the date range taken
- For resolved conditions include onset and resolution dates
