**Review the user's lab results, health history, medications, supplements, and recent symptoms. Based on this:**

* Output only the **tests or exams** (blood tests, imaging, physical exams, etc.) that need to be **repeated** or **newly ordered**.
* For each test, include:

  * **When** to do it (e.g., 1 month, 3 months)
  * **Why** it’s needed (brief clinical rationale)
  * Any **special instructions** (e.g., fasting, timing, preparation)

Be **succinct**. Focus only on exams relevant to:

* Out-of-range results
* Monitoring of chronic conditions
* Medication or supplement effects
* New or worsening symptoms

Avoid unnecessary commentary. Just list the needed tests, timing, rationale, and instructions.
